# 🎬 Cinema Performance vs Weather Conditions

## 🧩 Project Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between weather conditions and cinema attendance across UCI Cinemas in Italy (2015–2024).  
The goal is to identify how factors like rain, temperature, and weekends affect audience behavior, providing actionable insights for planning and marketing.

## 🎯 Business Question
- How does weather influence cinema attendance?
- Are there seasonal patterns or regional differences?
- Can we identify “high-probability” attendance days for promotions?

## 🧠 Key Insights (post-analysis)
- Rainy days increase attendance by X% compared to sunny days.
- Hot summers correlate with lower attendance (–Y%).
- Regional differences: Northern vs Southern cinemas show different sensitivity to weather.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **SQL**: Data cleaning, aggregation, joins.
- **Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)**: Exploratory analysis and visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Analysis workflow.
- **PowerPoint / Canva**: Final presentation.

## 📊 Dataset Description
- `cinema_attendance.csv`: daily admissions, box office, location, date.
